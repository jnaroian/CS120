  <h2> Jacob Naroian</h2>
  <p>I wanted to take this class because I really want to learn how to make websites. <br>
    I have experience with python, specifically algorithm writing, and knowing how to <br>
    write and read CSS and html will integrate with my python knowledge and make me a<br>
     better programmer</p>

  <h3> <a href="https://www.daveshotchicken.com"> Favorite restaurant: Dave's Hot Chicken</a><br>
    I really like this restaurant because I used to go there with my friends and I <br>
    have a lot of good memories about it. The food is also really good so that's a plus. </a></h3>

    I also do not like pickles or onions on my burger so I would prefer those to not be <br>
    included. As long as the burger is medium rare or medium cooked, it will be equally good.
